Climate Change: A Global Challenge

Overview:
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global weather patterns and average temperatures. It is primarily caused by human activities that increase greenhouse gas concentrations in Earth's atmosphere.

Key Causes:
1. Burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas)
2. Deforestation and land-use changes
3. Industrial processes and manufacturing
4. Agricultural practices and livestock farming

Major Impacts:
- Rising global temperatures
- Sea level rise and coastal flooding
- Increased frequency of extreme weather events
- Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem disruption
- Food and water security challenges

Solutions and Mitigation:
1. Renewable energy adoption
2. Energy efficiency improvements
3. Forest conservation and reforestation
4. Sustainable agriculture practices
5. Carbon pricing and emissions trading

International Response:
- Paris Agreement (2015)
- UN Sustainable Development Goals
- Carbon reduction commitments
- International climate finance
